    <p>
      Faraday's Law states that whenever the magnetic flux through a loop of conductor material (like wire) is changing, an incduced EMF will be created in wire. An EMF is a potential difference, or energy gradient similar to voltage, in the circuit loop that can cause a voltage to be present and current to run. Unlike voltage, however, there is no potential difference between any two points.
    </p>


    <p>Most Faraday's Law problems require you to determine the magnitude of this EMF, whose value is simply the rate of change (derivative) of magnetic flux. </p>
    

    <h2>What is Magnetic Flux ($\Phi$)?</h2>

    
    <p>If you already know what flux is, you can skip these next two paragraphs <a href="#skipflux">here</a> (although this is also a good refresher). A common analogy for 2D flux is thinking of flux as the flow rate of water as it exits a rigid pipe. Imagine water flowing smoothly and uniformly out of a pipe, but you can change the water's velocity $v_{water}$ and the cross-sectional area $A_{pipe}$ of the pipe in real time. How would changing those variables change the flow rate (flux) of water out of the pipe?</p>
    

    <p id="skipflux">Well, if we make the pipe's cross section X times greater and keep the same flow speed, the flux will increase by a factor of X. If we increase the speed by a factor of Y, then flux will be Y times greater. Increasing the cross sectional area or increasing the flow speed will both increase the rate at which water is dumped out of the pipe nozzle. Mathematically, $\Phi_{water} \propto v_{water} A_{pipe}$. Additionally, $\Phi_{water} = \vec{v}_{water} \cdot \vec{A}_{pipe}$ (note the dot product in there!). For extra material visit <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/integrating-multivariable-functions/line-integrals-in-vector-fields-articles/a/flux-in-two-dimensions" target="_blank">Khan Academy (Article)</a>.</p>


    <div class="centered"><img src="./Faraday's Law MEDIA/water_flux.png" alt="water flux through pipe"></div>


    <p>Magnetic flux is a similar concept and is calculated so: $\Phi_{B} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} = BA\cos{(\theta)}$. This basically states that if you have a 2D surface in 3D space with a uniform magnetic field through it, the magnetic flux through that surface is equal to magnetic field strength multiplied by the area of the surface multiplied by their dot product (cosine of angle between magnetic field lines and surface normal vector). Because of the dot product, if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface then $\vec{\Phi}_{B} = \vec{B}A$. This algebraic formula only works if magnetic field is uniform throughout the surface.</p>
    
    
    <p>If magnetic field varies, you must integrate the flux: $\Phi = \int \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{A}$. Also remember $ \mathrm{d} \vec{\Phi_{B}} = \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{A} $.


    <div class="equation"><span class="bigEquation">\[     \Phi_{B} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} = BA\cos{(\theta)} = \int \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{A} = \int B \cos{(\theta)} \mathrm{d}A     \]</span></div>


    <p>Finally, keep in mind that you can also think of magnetic flux as the "total amount of magnetic field lines" going through a 2D surface. And after you get your magnetic flux function, Faraday's law states that its derivative is the function for magnitude of the EMF. For power, use Joule's law: $P = I\varepsilon = I^{2}R = \frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{R}$.</p>


    <h2>Defining the Inductive Loop</h2>

    <p>Using Faraday's Law, you can calculate the induced EMF inside any 2D loop. To make the math simpler, it is best to make the loop a simple 2D shape like a circle or a rectangle. The area vector is the normal of the inductive loop area. Remember that when the magnetic field lines are parallel to the normal of the surface, the dot product, and therefore the flux, is maximized.</p>


    <p>It should be noted that the induced EMF produced by a changing magnetic field produces a continuous EMF around the circuit. Unlike in the case of electrical voltage, there is no net potential energy difference between any two points on the circuit. A magnetic force is applied on each electron. Similar to how accelerating charges create an increasing magnetic flux around them, an increasing magnetic flux around charges accelerates them. Voltage and induced EMF are both EMFs, so the line integral of induced EMF around the circuit perimeter is similar to that of voltage, $\Delta V = \int \vec{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} x$</p>


    <div class="equation"><span class="bigEquation">\[\varepsilon = \oint \vec{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{l}\]</span></div>
    

    <h2>Important Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In many cases, your coil of wire/conductor will only make one loop. In this case, $N = 1$ and so Faraday's law simplifies to $\varepsilon = - \frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}$.</li>
      <li>Yes, induction does violate Kirchoff's voltage law (KVL) since you are generating a continuous potential difference from outside the circuit. KVL does not account for the fact that there is a changing magnetic field that is adding energy into the system and warping the spacetime of the circuit's environment.</li>
      <li>Magnetic fields are a result of electric fields and special relativity. The magnetic force is a ficticious force, similar to the centrifugal force. Refer to Veritasium's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0">How Special Relativity Makes Magnets Work</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maxwell's Equation Form</h2>


    <p>British physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) made improvements to Faraday's and Ampere's laws alongside many other advancements in electrodynamic physics. Faraday's Law gives you that $\oint \vec{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{l} = - \frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi_B}{\mathrm{d} t}$. The Ampere-Maxwell Law is similar, $\oint \vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi_E}{\mathrm{d} t}$. Notice that if you differentiate the two equations to ignore the constant ($\mu_0 I$) and turn each first-degree derivative into a second-degree derivative, the two equations just switch electric and magnetic field variables. The two equations can then be substituted in a way that fulfills the wave equation. This is because the two fields propagate each other as an electromagnetic wave travelling at the speed of light.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Magnetic Flux can be calculated using these formulas (choose the appropriate one): $\Phi_{B} = BA\cos{(\theta)} = \int B \cos{(\theta)} \mathrm{d}A$.</li>
      <li>For the inductive loop you are analyzing, you should try to choose a simple shape (circle/rectangle) to simplify calculations.</li>
      <li>To find power, substitute your induced EMF into Joule's law: $P = I\varepsilon = I^{2}R = \frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{R}$.</li>

      <h4 id="button2_1">Show Solution <i class="arrow right"></i></h4>
      <div class="answer" id="answer2_1">
        <p>(a) This is a pure math/derivative problem. Simply start with the equation first:</p>

        <span>\[  \varepsilon  =  -N  \frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi}{\mathrm{d} t}  \]</span>
        <span>\[  \varepsilon  =  -(1)  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \left[  B(t)  A  \cos{(\theta)}  \right]  \]</span>


        <p>Area and the dot product cosine coefficient are constants, and can be factored out of the derivative:</p>


        <span>\[  \varepsilon  =  -\cos{(60^{\circ})}  \pi (0.01)^{2}  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \left[  5(1-0.7^{-t})  \right]  \]</span>


        <p>The 5 can be factored out, and the constant inside the derivative can be eliminated:</p>


        <span>\[  \varepsilon  =  -5\cos{(60^{\circ})}  \pi (0.01)^{2}  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \left[  -0.7^{-t}  \right]  \]</span>
        <span>\[  \varepsilon  =  \left[  -5\cos{(60^{\circ})}  \pi (0.01)^{2}  \ln(0.7)  \right]  e^{-t}  \]</span>
        <span>\[  \therefore \varepsilon(t)  =  \left[  0.028 \right] e^{-t}  \]</span>


        <p>(b) To find power, simply use Joule's Law:</p>

        <span>\[  P  =  IV  =  \frac{V^{2}}{R}  \]</span>
        <span>\[  P  =  \frac{\varepsilon(t)^{2}}{R}  \]</span>

        <p>Plug and chug variables into the formula, replacing voltage with EMF without compromise. Remember that $t= 1\mathrm{s}$.</p>

        <span>\[  P(1)  =  \frac{\varepsilon(1)^{2}}{R}  \]</span>
        <span>\[  P(1)  =  \frac{(0.28  \times  e^-1)^{2}}{4}  \]</span>
        <span>\[  \therefore  P(1)  =  2.7 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{W}  \]</span>
