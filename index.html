    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <p><em>Michael Faraday</em> (1791-1867) was an English physicist and inventor. He was a great scientist who contributed greatly to our early understanding of electricity and magnetism. Faraday (left) was most famous for his research on diamagnetism and the discovery of electrolysis and electromagnetic induction.</p>

    <p>However, Faraday did not discover induction - credit must be given to Hans Christian Orsted (right), a Danish scientist, for discovering the link between magnetism and electrical current. Orsted noticed this connection in one of his demonstrations when a live circuit caused a nearby compass needle to wiggle. Faraday built on Orsted's findings and combined their collective observations into a single equation, Faraday's Law of Induction (refer to page 2). The video below shows Faraday's most famous experiment: a permanent magnet is moved through a solenoid coil. A galvanometer measures the magnitude and direction of the current in the wire. When and only when the magnet is <em>moving,</em> there is a nonzero current produced in the wire. It will be explained further, but notice also that the longer coils that contain more loops of coil also produce more current. Also note that the direction of movement determines the direction of the current.</p>
      

    <p>If you remember the conservation of energy and think "hey, the current cannot be free energy", then you are right - there is a magnetic force <em>opposing</em> the motion of the magnet. Whether the magnet is moving in or out of the coil, there is always a force <em>opposing</em> it. This is the principle known as Lenz's Law, which will be explained in page 3.</p>

    <p>The discovery of electromagnetic induction revolutionalized the world. The discovery of electromagnetic induction induction meant that electrical current energy could be converted into a physical force, and vice versa. With electrical generators and motors, an entire new generation of technology was made possible. Here are some well-known applications of electromagnetic induction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Electrical transformers</li>
      <li>Electric cars</li>
      <li>Maglev trains</li>
      <li>Induction stoves</li>
      <li>MRI machines and mass spectrometers</li>
      <li>Electric generators for all sources of energy except solar (which directly produce electric current)</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Summary/Learning Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Faraday's Law <strong>quantitatively</strong> states that a changing magnetic flux induces a <em>proportional</em> changing EMF.</li>
      <li>Lenz's law allows us to <strong>qualitatively</strong> determine the direction of that EMF, based on right hand rules.</li>
      <li>Later, Maxwell's version of the equation more accurately and generally states that a changing magnetic field causes a proportional changing electric field.</li>
